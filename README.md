### READ ME
This is a project developed in the Discovery trail of RocketSeat's Next Level Week event. It was an intense course of 5 days straight of coding and learning. 
It was my first time creating a full application from the front-end to the back-end. I learned a lot of things about how a page is created and how to organize all the files in a project, dividing them by their functions inside the application. 
Now the challenge is to modify it and add some new funcionalities to improve it and make it better.
